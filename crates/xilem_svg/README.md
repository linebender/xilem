# Xilemsvg prototype

This is a proof of concept showing how to use `xilem_core` to render interactive vector graphics into SVG DOM nodes, running in a browser. It is provided as a library and some examples.

The easiest way to run the examples is to use [Trunk]. Go into the appropriate subdirectory of `web_examples`, run `trunk serve`, then navigate the browser to the link provided (usually `http://localhost:8080`).
