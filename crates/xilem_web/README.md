# `xilem_web` prototype

This is an early prototype of a potential implementation of the Xilem architecture using DOM elements 
as Xilem elements (unfortunately the two concepts have the same name). This uses xilem_core under the hood,
and offers a proof that it can be used outside of `xilem` proper.

The easiest way to run it is to use [Trunk]. Run `trunk serve`, then navigate the browser to the link provided (usually `http://localhost:8080`).
