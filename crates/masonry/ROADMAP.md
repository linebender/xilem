# Design stuff

What referential are various values using?

transform_scroll translates mouse events

General note: add hover detection *everywhere*. It's what makes the UI feel alive.

## Flex stuff

Flex algo
- Does Tennent's Correspondence Principle apply to Wrappers in a Flex container?
- Visualize how much "spring" each element has

Difference between
- Window(Button)
- Window(Flex(Button))

- Flex(stuff)
- Portal(Flex(stuff))

Flex alignment vs text alignment

Portal.must_fill, Portal.constrain_horizontal, Portan.constrain_vertical

In druid Spinner needs parent constraints to decide its size.
Feels like that shouldn't be allowed.

Use "*It's a Wonderful World* boardgame"-inspired pass order.

See this thread: https://xi.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/147922-new-members/topic/Second.20book.20example.20doesn't.20work/

How does Flex interact with Viewport?
-> use call context for debugging (wait, what does that mean again?)

Make library of commonly desired layouts
- Center object vertically
- Horizontally
- Side gutters
- Document format

How do make easily-readable test of Flex, FillStrat layout?


## Passes

Passes have access to
- on_event
-> mut self, mut ContextState, WidgetState.<layout>, mut WidgetState.<passes>, mut WidgetState.<Status>, get_widget_view()
- on_status_change
-> mut self, ContextState, WidgetState.<layout>, mut WidgetState.<passes>, WidgetState.<Status>
- lifecycle
-> mut self, mut ContextState, WidgetState.<layout>, mut WidgetState.<passes>, mut WidgetState.<Status>, get_widget_view()
- layout
-> self, mut ContextState, mut WidgetState.<layout>, WidgetState.<passes>, WidgetState.<Status>
- paint
-> self, mut ContextState, mut WidgetState.<layout>, WidgetState.<passes>, WidgetState.<Status>
- WidgetView
-> mut self, mut ContextState, WidgetState.<layout>, mut WidgetState.<passes>, mut WidgetState.<Status>, get_widget_view()

WidgetAdded and similar events are an anti-pattern. Constructors should stand on their own. (is it actually possible though?)


## Pointer status

Default(Option(cursor))
Active(Option(cursor))
Disabled
Hidden

See https://xi.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/147926-druid/topic/.22hot.22.20in.20the.20presence.20of.20multiple.20pointers/near/254524486


## Invariants

Druid invariants
- layout != <prev>.layout                       => request_layout() has been called
- child.origin != <prev>.child.origin           => request_layout() has been called
- <paint-calls> != <prev>.<paint-calls>         => request_paint() has been called
- children() != <prev>.children()               => children_changed is set
- !event.handled && hovered || self.has_focus   => recurse event
- lifecycle                                     => recurse lifecycle
- !is_hidden()                                  => recurse layout
- !is_hidden() && is_visible()                  => recurse paint
- is_focusable                                  => must be const
- ids are unique


## Profiling

Record spans, with:
- pass name
- widget id
- work type
- useful/redundant/testing
- include-recursed-time-in-total-time

-> percentage of work that is useful
-> what type of work


## Debug info

- Isolate subgraph of trace during errors

Event debug info:
- layout during event
- tree of visited widgets
- respective mouse pose

Widget Debuggging
- Need to see the layout tree at any given point
- Need to see which subwidgets were not rendered and why
- Need to see the properties of each widget *at render time* both graphically and in text form

## Resource handling

See swift proposal https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0271-package-manager-resources.md
