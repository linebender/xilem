# The default Clippy value is capped at 8 bytes, which was chosen to improve performance on 32-bit.
# Given that we are building for the future and even low-end mobile phones have 64-bit CPUs,
# it makes sense to optimize for 64-bit and accept the performance hits on 32-bit.
# 16 bytes is the number of bytes that fits into two 64-bit CPU registers.
