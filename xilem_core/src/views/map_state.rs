/// An adapter which allows using a component which only uses one field of the current state.
///
/// In Xilem, many components are functions of the form `fn my_component(&mut SomeState) -> impl WidgetView<SomeState>`.
/// For example, a date picker might be of the form `fn date_picker(&mut Date) -> impl WidgetView<Date>`.
/// The `lens` View allows using these components in a higher-level component, where the higher level state has
/// a field of the inner component's state type.
/// For example, a flight finder app might have a `Date` field for the currently selected date.
///
/// The parameters of this view are:
/// - `component`: The child component the lens is being created for.
/// - `state`: The current outer view's state
/// - `map`: A function from the higher-level state type to `component`'s state type
///
/// This is a wrapper around [`map_state`].
/// That view can be used if the child doesn't follow the expected component signature.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// In code, the date picker example might look like:
///
/// ```
/// # use xilem_core::docs::{DocsView as WidgetView, State as Date, State as Flight, some_component as date_picker};
/// use xilem_core::lens;
///
/// fn app_logic(state: &mut FlightPlanner) -> impl WidgetView<FlightPlanner> {
///     lens(date_picker, state, |state| &mut state.date)

///     date: Date,
///     available_flights: Vec<Flight>,
