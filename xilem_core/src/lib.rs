//! Xilem Core provides primitives which are used by [Xilem][] (a cross-platform GUI toolkit) and [Xilem Web][] (a web frontend framework).
//! If you are using Xilem, [its documentation][xilem docs] will probably be more helpful for you. <!-- TODO: In the long-term, we probably also need a book? -->
//!
//! Xilem apps will interact with some of the functions from this crate, in particular [`memoize`][].
//! Xilem apps which use custom widgets (and therefore must implement custom views), will implement the [`View`][] trait.
//!
//! If you wish to implement the Xilem pattern in a different domain (such as for a terminal user interface), this crate can be used to do so.
//! Though, while Xilem Core should be able to support all kinds of domains, the crate prioritizes the ergonomics for users of Xilem.
//!
//! ## Hot reloading
//!
//! Xilem Core does not currently include infrastructure to enable hot reloading, but this is planned.
//! The current proposal would split the application into two processes:
//!
//!  - The app process, which contains the app state and create the views, which would be extremely lightweight and can be recompiled and restarted quickly.
//!  - The display process, which contains the widgets and would be long-lived, updating to match the new state of the view tree provided by the app process.
//!
//! ## Quickstart
//!
//! <!-- TODO? -->
//!
//! ## `no_std` support
//!
//! Xilem Core supports running with `#![no_std]`, but does use [`alloc`][] to be available.
//!
//! It is plausible that this reactivity pattern could be used without allocation being required, but that is not provided by this package.
//! If you wish to use Xilem Core in environments where an allocator is not available, feel free to bring this up on [Zulip][Zulip].
