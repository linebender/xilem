/// A type which can be a [`View`]. Imposes no requirements on the underlying type.
/// Should be implemented alongside every `View` implementation:
/// ```ignore
/// impl<...> ViewMarker for Button<...> {}
/// impl<...> View<...> for Button<...> {...}
/// ```
///
/// ## Details
///
/// Because `View` is generic, Rust [allows you](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/implementations.html#orphan-rules) to implement this trait for certain non-local types.
/// These non-local types can include `Vec<_>` and `Option<_>`.
/// If this trait were not present, those implementations of `View` would conflict with those types' implementations of `ViewSequence`.
/// This is because every `View` type also implementations `ViewSequence`.
/// Since `ViewMarker` is not generic, these non-local implementations are not permitted for this trait, which means that the conflicting implementation cannot happen.
pub trait ViewMarker {}

/// A lightweight, short-lived representation of the state of a retained
/// structure, usually a user interface node.
///
/// This is the central reactivity primitive in Xilem.
/// An app will generate a tree of these objects (the view tree) to represent
/// the state it wants to show in its element tree.
/// The framework will then run methods on these views to create the associated
/// element tree, or to perform incremental updates to the element tree.
/// Once this process is complete, the element tree will reflect the view tree.
/// The view tree is also used to dispatch messages, such as those sent when a
/// user presses a button.
///
/// The view tree is transitory and is retained only long enough to dispatch
/// messages and then serve as a reference for diffing for the next view tree.
///
/// The `View` trait is parameterized by `State`, which is known as the "app state",
/// and also a type for actions which are passed up the tree in message
/// propagation.
/// During message handling, mutable access to the app state is given to view nodes,
/// which will in turn generally expose it to callbacks.
///
/// Due to restrictions of the [orphan rules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/implementations.html#orphan-rules),
/// `ViewMarker` needs to be implemented for every type that implements `View`, see [`ViewMarker`] for more details.
/// For example:
/// ```ignore
/// impl<...> ViewMarker for Button<...> {}
/// impl<...> View<...> for Button<...> {...}
/// ```
///
/// ## Alloc

/// In order to support the default open-ended [`DynMessage`] type as `Message`, this trait requires an
/// allocator to be available.
