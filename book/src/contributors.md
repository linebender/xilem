# Contributors

The Xilem Book is a community-driven effort to create comprehensive documentation for learning Xilem. This page recognizes everyone who has contributed to making this resource possible.

## Project Contributors

This book exists thanks to the following people:

**[Olivier FAURE (PoignardAzur)](https://github.com/PoignardAzur)** provided the initial outline and structure proposal that shaped how the book is organized.

**[Richard Alves (richarddalves)](https://github.com/richarddalves)** created the mdBook infrastructure and implemented the detailed chapter structure, setting up the foundation that makes it easy for others to contribute content.

## How You Can Contribute

> We welcome contributions of all kinds! Whether you're fixing a typo, writing a new chapter, or improving existing content, your help is appreciated.

> Every contribution, no matter how small, makes this book better for the entire Xilem community.

The book is still in its early stages, with many chapters waiting to be written. You can help by writing new content, improving existing chapters, adding examples, fixing typos, or suggesting structural improvements.

If you would like to contribute, you can start by looking at the book structure and identifying chapters that interest you. The Xilem project discusses development in the Linebender Zulip, specifically in the xilem channel, where you can ask questions and coordinate your contribution plans.

When you submit a pull request that gets merged, feel free to add your name to this page as part of that PR. We want to recognize everyone who helps make this documentation better.
