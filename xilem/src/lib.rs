//! Xilem is a UI toolkit. It combines ideas from `Flutter`, `SwiftUI`, and `Elm`.
//! Like all of these, it uses lightweight view objects, diffing them to provide
//! minimal updates to a retained UI. Like `SwiftUI`, it is strongly typed.
//!
//! The talk *[Xilem: Let's Build High Performance Rust UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvfNipIcRiQ)* by Raph Levien
//! was presented at the RustNL conference in 2024, and gives a video introduction to these ideas.
//! Xilem is implemented as a reactive layer on top of [Masonry][masonry], a widget toolkit which is developed alongside Xilem.
//! Masonry itself is built on top of a wide array of foundational Rust UI projects:
//!
//! * Rendering is provided by [Vello][masonry::vello], a high performance GPU compute-centric 2D renderer.
//! * GPU compute infrastructure is provided by [wgpu][masonry::vello::wgpu].
//! * Text layout is provided by [Parley][masonry::parley].
//! * Accessibility is provided by [AccessKit][] ([docs][accesskit_docs]).
//! * Window handling is provided by [winit][].
//!
//! Xilem can currently be considered to be in an alpha state. Lots of things need improvements (including this documentation!).
//!
//! There is also a [blog post][xilem_blog] from when Xilem was first introduced.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! A simple incrementing counter application looks like:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use winit::error::EventLoopError;
//! use xilem::view::{button, flex, label};
//! use xilem::{EventLoop, WindowOptions, WidgetView, Xilem};
//!
//! #[derive(Default)]
//! struct Counter {
//!     num: i32,
//! }
//!
//! fn app_logic(data: &mut Counter) -> impl WidgetView<Counter> + use<> {
//!     flex((
//!         label(format!("{}", data.num)),
//!         button("increment", |data: &mut Counter| data.num += 1),
//!     ))
//! }
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), EventLoopError> {
//!     let app = Xilem::new_simple(Counter::default(), app_logic, WindowOptions::new("Counter app"));
//!     app.run_in(EventLoop::with_user_event())?;
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A key feature of Xilem's architecture is that the application's state, in this case `Counter`, is an arbitrary `'static` Rust type.
//! In this example, `app_logic` is the root component, which creates the view value it returns.
//! This, in turn, leads to corresponding Masonry widgets being created, in this case a button and a label.
//! When the button is pressed, the number will be incremented, and then `app_logic` will be re-ran.
//! The returned view will be compared with its previous value, which will minimally update the contents of these widgets.
//! As the `num` field's value has changed, the `label`'s formatted text will be different.
//! This means that the label widget's text will be updated, updating the value displayed to the user.
//! In this case, because the button is the same, it will not be updated.
//!
//! More examples can be found [in the repository][xilem_examples].
//!
//! **Note: The linked examples are for the `main` branch of Xilem. If you are using a released version, please view the examples in the tag for that release.**
//!
//! ## Reactive layer
//!
//! The core concepts of the reactive layer are explained in [Xilem Core][xilem_core].
//!
//! ## View elements
//!
//! The primitives your `Xilem` appâ€™s view tree will generally be constructed from:
//!
//! * [`flex`][crate::view::flex]: defines how items will be arranged in a row or column
//! * [`grid`][crate::view::grid]: divides a window into regions and defines the relationship
//!   between inner elements in terms of size and position
//! * [`sized_box`][crate::view::sized_box]: forces its child to have a specific width and/or height
//! * [`split`][crate::view::split]: contains two views splitting the area either vertically or horizontally which can be resized.
//! * [`button`][crate::view::button]: basic button element
//! * [`image`][crate::view::image]: displays a bitmap image
//! * [`portal`][crate::view::portal]: a scrollable region
//! * [`progress_bar`][crate::view::progress_bar]: progress bar element
//! * [`prose`][crate::view::prose]: displays immutable, selectable text
//! * [`text_input`][crate::view::text_input]: allows text to be edited by the user
//! * [`task`][crate::view::task]: launch an async task which will run until the view is no longer in the tree
//! * [`zstack`][crate::view::zstack]: an element that lays out its children on top of each other
//!
//! You should also expect to use the adapters from Xilem Core, including:
//!
//! * [`lens`][crate::core::lens]: an adapter for using a component from a field of the current state.
//! * [`memoize`][crate::core::memoize]: allows you to avoid recreating views you know won't have changed, based on a key.
