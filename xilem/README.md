Xilem is a UI toolkit.
It combines ideas from Flutter, SwiftUI, and Elm.
Like all of these, it uses lightweight view objects, diffing them to provide minimal updates to a retained UI.
Like SwiftUI, it is strongly typed.
For more details on Xilem's reactive architecture see [Xilem: an architecture for UI in Rust].

Xilem's reactive layer is built on top of a wide array of foundational Rust UI projects, e.g.:
* Widgets are provided by [Masonry], which is a fork of the now discontinued [Druid] UI toolkit.
* Rendering is provided by [Vello], a high performance GPU compute-centric 2D renderer.
* GPU compute infrastructure is provided by [wgpu].
* Text support is provided by [Parley], [Fontique], [Swash], and [Skrifa]. 
* Accessibility is provided by [AccessKit].
* Window handling is provided by [winit].

Xilem can currently be considered to be in an alpha state.
Lots of things need improvements.

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Xilem has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.79** and later.

Future versions of Xilem might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

<summary>Click here if compiling fails.</summary>

As time has passed, some of Xilem's dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don't want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

```sh
# Use the problematic dependency's name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```
