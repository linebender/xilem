Xilem is a UI toolkit. It combines ideas from `Flutter`, `SwiftUI`, and `Elm`.
Like all of these, it uses lightweight view objects, diffing them to provide
minimal updates to a retained UI. Like `SwiftUI`, it is strongly typed.

The talk *[Xilem: Let's Build High Performance Rust UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvfNipIcRiQ)* by Raph Levien
was presented at the RustNL conference in 2024, and gives a video introduction to these ideas.
Xilem is implemented as a reactive layer on top of [Masonry][masonry], a widget toolkit which is developed alongside Xilem.
Masonry itself is built on top of a wide array of foundational Rust UI projects:

* Rendering is provided by [Vello][masonry::vello], a high performance GPU compute-centric 2D renderer.
* GPU compute infrastructure is provided by [wgpu][masonry::vello::wgpu].
* Text layout is provided by [Parley][masonry::parley].
* Accessibility is provided by [AccessKit][] ([docs][accesskit_docs]).
* Window handling is provided by [winit][].

Xilem can currently be considered to be in an alpha state. Lots of things need improvements (including this documentation!).

There is also a [blog post][xilem_blog] from when Xilem was first introduced.

## Example

A simple incrementing counter application looks like:

```rust
use winit::error::EventLoopError;
use xilem::view::{button, flex, label};
use xilem::{EventLoop, WidgetView, Xilem};

#[derive(Default)]
struct Counter {
    num: i32,
}

fn app_logic(data: &mut Counter) -> impl WidgetView<Counter> + use<> {
    flex((
        label(format!("{}", data.num)),
        button("increment", |data: &mut Counter| data.num += 1),
    ))
}

fn main() -> Result<(), EventLoopError> {
    let app = Xilem::new(Counter::default(), app_logic);
    app.run_windowed(EventLoop::with_user_event(), "Counter app".into())?;
    Ok(())
}
```

A key feature of Xilem's architecture is that the application's state, in this case `Counter`, is an arbitrary `'static` Rust type.
In this example, `app_logic` is the root component, which creates the view value it returns.
This, in turn, leads to corresponding Masonry widgets being created, in this case a button and a label.
When the button is pressed, the number will be incremented, and then `app_logic` will be re-ran.
The returned view will be compared with its previous value, which will minimally update the contents of these widgets.
As the `num` field's value has changed, the `label`'s formatted text will be different.
This means that the label widget's text will be updated, updating the value displayed to the user.
In this case, because the button is the same, it will not be updated.

More examples can be found [in the repository][xilem_examples].

**Note: The linked examples are for the `main` branch of Xilem. If you are using a released version, please view the examples in the tag for that release.**

## Reactive layer

The core concepts of the reactive layer are explained in [Xilem Core][xilem_core].

## View elements

The primitives your `Xilem` appâ€™s view tree will generally be constructed from:

* [`flex`][crate::view::flex]: defines how items will be arranged in a row or column
* [`grid`][crate::view::grid]: divides a window into regions and defines the relationship
  between inner elements in terms of size and position
* [`sized_box`][crate::view::sized_box]: forces its child to have a specific width and/or height
* [`button`][crate::view::button]: basic button element
* [`image`][crate::view::image]: displays a bitmap image
* [`portal`][crate::view::portal]: a scrollable region
* [`progress_bar`][crate::view::progress_bar]: progress bar element
* [`prose`][crate::view::prose]: displays immutable, selectable text
* [`textbox`][crate::view::textbox]: allows text to be edited by the user
* [`task`][crate::view::task]: launch an async task which will run until the view is no longer in the tree
* [`zstack`][crate::view::zstack]: an element that lays out its children on top of each other

You should also expect to use the adapters from Xilem Core, including:

* [`lens`][crate::core::lens]: an adapter for using a component from a field of the current state.
* [`memoize`][crate::core::memoize]: allows you to avoid recreating views you know won't have changed, based on a key.

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Xilem has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.85** and later.

Future versions of Xilem might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

<details>
<summary>Click here if compiling fails.</summary>

As time has passed, some of Xilem's dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don't want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

```sh
# Use the problematic dependency's name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```

</details>
