# Placehero User Data

This folder is used for your user data when you run [Placehero](../README.md).
Do not share the contents of this folder, as it primarily contains login tokens and profile data.

Note that currently nothing actually uses this folder; instead it is reserved.
We have done this to reduce the likelihood of accidental credential uploads when we implement login.
