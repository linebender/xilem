A mastodon client written in Xilem.

We're assuming that all Mastodon servers supported are trusted (and so it's not a
privacy violation for them to know that two accounts you log in to are linked).
This link survives even if you log out of one and into the other, even in different sessions.
If this doesn't apply to you, we recommend not using Placehero.

Features:

- None
