[features]
# This crate contains two implementations of a tree for use in masonry, one safe and the other unsafe.
# The safe tree is known to work, and serves as the baseline implementation and is used by default.
# The unsafe tree leverages a hashmap as an arena and is designed for higher performance: it leverages unsafe code to achieve this.
# The unsafe tree is not yet fully tested, and is not used by default.
