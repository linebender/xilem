//! Masonry Core provides the base GUI engine for Masonry.
//!
//! Masonry's widgets are implemented in the Masonry crate, which re-exports this crate as `masonry::core`.
//! Most users who wish to use Masonry for creating applications (and UI libraries) should
//! prefer to depend on Masonry directly (i.e. the `masonry` crate).
//! [Masonry's documentation] can be found on docs.rs.
//!
//! Masonry Core provides:
//!
//! - [`Widget`][core::Widget], the trait for GUI widgets in Masonry.
//! - Event handling and bubbling, using types from [`ui-events`][ui_events] for interoperability.
//! - Communication between parent and child widgets for layout.
//! - Compositing of widget's content (to be rendered using [Vello][vello]).
//! - Creation of accessibility trees using [Accesskit][accesskit].
//! - APIs for widget manipulation (such as [`WidgetMut`][core::WidgetMut]).
//! - The [`Action`][core::Widget::Action] mechanism by which widgets send events to the application.
//!
//! Details of many of these can be found in the [Pass System][doc::pass_system] article.
//!
//! If you're writing a library in the Masonry ecosystem, you should depend on `masonry_core`
//! directly where possible (instead of depending on `masonry`).
//! This will allow applications using your library to have greater compilation parallelism.
//! Cases where this apply include:
//!
//! - Writing an alternative driver for Masonry (alike to [Masonry Winit]).
//! - Witing a library containing one or more custom widget (such as a 2d mapping widget).
//!
//! Masonry Core can also be used by by applications wishing to not use Masonry's provided
//! set of widgets, so as to have more control.
//! This can be especially useful if you wish to exactly match the appearance of an existing library,
//! or enforce following a specific design guide, which Masonry's widgets may not always allow.
//! Masonry Core provides a useful shared set of functionality to implement alternative widget libraries.
//! Note that Masonry Core is currently focused primarily on the main Masonry crate itself, as we're
//! not aware of any projects using Masonry Core as described in this paragraph.
