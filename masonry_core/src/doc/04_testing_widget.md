Masonry supports testing your UI in a headless setting, with similar capabilities to testing tools which use the [WebDriver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver) standard for web dev.

While sometimes you can go a long way keeping your business logic code in pure functions, the best practice is to test your GUI code as well.
You want to write "When I click on this button this widget should appear" into your codebase in a way CI can enforce mechanically.

Enabling this kind of testing is a core design goal of Masonry.

To demonstrate how testing works in Masonry, let's write a test suite for our `ColorRectangle` widget from two chapters ago.


## Creating the harness

First, let's write a test module with a first unit test:

```rust,ignore
// We place this block at the end of the file where we implemented ColorRectangle
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use insta::assert_debug_snapshot;
    use masonry::testing::{widget_ids, TestHarness, TestWidgetExt};

    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn simple_rect() {
        let [rect_id] = widget_ids();
        let widget = ColorRectangle::new(Size::new(20.0, 20.0), Color::BLUE).with_id(rect_id);

        let harness = TestHarness::create(widget);

        assert_debug_snapshot!(harness.root_widget());

        // ...
    }
}
```

<!-- TODO - Rewrite this once we have a better way to assign ids to widgets. -->

First, we create a `ColorRectangle` with an arbitrary size and color.
We use `TestWidgetExt::with_id()` to assign it a pre-drawn id.
(As a side-effect, this also wraps our `ColorRectangle` in a [`SizedBox`] widget.)

Then we instantiate the [`TestHarness`], with our (wrapped) `ColorRectangle` as the root.

We use `TestHarness::root_widget()` to get a [`WidgetRef`] to our root.

A [`WidgetRef`] is a rich reference to both a widget and its metadata.
We can use it to get a widget's origin, size, flags, etc.

It also has a `Debug` impl, which prints the widget's name and the sub-tree of all its children.
We use that debug impl with `insta::assert_debug_snapshot` to get an easy test checking the widget exists.

<!-- TODO - Include snapshot result. -->


## Screenshot testing

So far our test isn't giving us much information.
We know that `ColorRectangle::new()` doesn't panic, and that's more or less it.

Let's add a visual test:

```rust,ignore
    // ...
    use masonry::assert_render_snapshot;

    #[test]
    fn simple_rect() {
        // ...

        assert_render_snapshot!(harness, "blue_rectangle");
    }
```

The [`assert_render_snapshot!`] macro takes a snapshot name, renders the current state of the app, and stores the render as a PNG next to the test, in a `./screenshots/` folder.

The rendered screenshot is compared against an existing file checked in your project, and panics if the reference file is meaningfully different (using [the NVIDIA FLIP algorithm](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/flip-a-difference-evaluator-for-alternating-images/)) or if there isn't one.

Adding screenshot tests lets you check both that your widget's `paint()` method runs correctly and to explicitly track and check in your widget's visual changes into version control.

That way, if an internal change happens to affect how a widget is displayed, failing screenshot tests will force you to consider whether the visual change is deliberate or an error.

<!-- TODO - Include screenshot. -->


## Simulating input

We can also use the harness as if we were a user interacting with a window.
The `TestHarness` types includes methods for mouse events, keyboard events, etc.

Let's create another snapshot test to check that our widget correctly changes color when the mouse hovers it:

```rust,ignore
    // ...

    #[test]
    fn hovered() {
        let [rect_id] = widget_ids();
        let widget = ColorRectangle::new(Size::new(20.0, 20.0), Color::BLUE).with_id(rect_id);

        let mut harness = TestHarness::create(widget);

        // Computes the rect's layout and sends an PointerEvent
        // placing the mouse at its center.
        harness.mouse_move_to(rect_id);
        assert_render_snapshot!(harness, "hovered_rectangle");
    }
```

<!-- TODO - Include screenshot. -->


## Testing `WidgetMut`

In some cases, you may want to run tests where the widget tree is modified after its creation.

Like `RenderRoot`, `TestHarness` has methods that take a closure and, inside of that closure, give you a `WidgetMut` to a specific widget.

Let's add a test that changes a rectangle's color, then checks its visual appearance:

```rust,ignore
    // ...

    #[test]
    fn hovered() {
        let [rect_id] = widget_ids();
        let widget = ColorRectangle::new(Size::new(20.0, 20.0), Color::BLUE).with_id(rect_id);

        let mut harness = TestHarness::create(widget);

        // Computes the rect's layout and sends an PointerEvent
        // placing the mouse at its center.
        harness.mouse_move_to(rect_id);
        assert_render_snapshot!(harness, "hovered_rectangle");
    }

    #[test]
    fn edit_rect() {
        let [rect_id] = widget_ids();
        let widget = ColorRectangle::new(Size::new(20.0, 20.0), Color::BLUE).with_id(rect_id);

        let mut harness = TestHarness::create(widget);

        harness.edit_widget(rect_id |mut rect| {
            let mut rect = rect.downcast::<ColorRectangle>();
            ColorRectangle::set_color(&mut rect, Size::new(50.0, 50.0));
            ColorRectangle::set_size(&mut rect, Color::RED);
        });

        assert_render_snapshot!(harness, "big_red_rectangle");
    }
```

<!-- TODO - Include screenshot. -->


## Testing actions

The `TestHarness` is also capable of reading actions emitted by our widget with the `pop_action()` method.

Since our `WidgetRectangle` doesn't emit actions, let's look at a unit test for the [`Button`] widget instead:

```rust
    #[test]
    fn simple_button() {
        let [button_id] = widget_ids();
        let widget = Button::new("Hello").with_id(button_id);

        let mut harness = TestHarness::create(widget);

        // ...

        harness.mouse_click_on(button_id);
        assert_eq!(
            harness.pop_action(),
            Some((Action::ButtonPressed(PointerButton::Primary), button_id))
        );
    }
```

Overall, this tutorial isn't an exhaustive list of the `TestHarness` API.

In general, `TestHarness` tries to implement methods matching every kind of behavior a user interacting with your app can have, using names that match the natural description of what the user does (e.g. `mouse_click_on`).

Read the [`TestHarness`] documentation for a full overview of its API.
