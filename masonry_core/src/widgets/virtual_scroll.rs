/// Each child of the virtual scroll widget has a signed 64 bit id (i.e. an `i64`), and items are laid out

/// The widget keeps track of which of these ids are loaded, and requests that more are loaded.
/// The widget requires these ids to be dense (that is, if it has a child with ids 1 and 3, it must have a child
/// with id 2).
///
/// This widget works in close coordinate with the [driver](crate::doc::doc_01_creating_app#the-driver) to
/// load the children; that is, the driver must provide the children when requested.
/// See [usage](#usage) for more details.
///
/// The Masonry example `virtual_fizzbuzz` shows how to use this widget.
/// It creates an infinitely explorable implementation of the game [Fizz buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz).
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// When you create the virtual scroll, you specify the initial "anchor"; that is an id for which the item will be on-screen.
/// If only a subset of ids are valid, then the valid range of ids widget *must* be set.
///
/// The widget will send a [`VirtualScrollAction`] whenever the children it requires to be loaded (the active children) changes.
/// To handle this, the driver must [add](Self::add_child) widgets for the ids which are in `target` but not in
/// `old_active`, and [remove](Self::remove_child) those which are in `old_active` but not in `target`.
/// (`VirtualScroll` does not remove the children itself to enable cleanup by the driver before the
/// children get removed).
/// You also need to call [`VirtualScroll::will_handle_action`] with this action, which allows the
/// `VirtualScroll` controller to know which children it expects to be valid. This avoids issues caused by
/// things going out of sync.
/// The docs for [`VirtualScrollAction`] include an example demonstrating this.
///
/// It is invalid to not provide all items requested.
/// For items which have not yet loaded, you should either:
/// 1) Provide a placeholder
/// 2) Restrict the valid range to exclude them
///
/// This widget avoids panicking and infinite loops in these cases, but this widget is not designed to
/// handle them, and so arbitrarily janky behaviour may occur.
///
/// As a special case, it is not possible to have an item with id [`i64::MAX`].
/// This is because of the internal use of exclusive ranges.
///
/// ## Caveats
///
/// This widget has been developed as an minimum viable solution, and so there are a number of known issues with it.
/// These are discussed below.
///
/// ### Transforms
///
/// Widgets can be [transformed](crate::core::WidgetMut::set_transform) arbitrarily from where their parent lays them out.
/// This interacts poorly with virtual scrolling, because an item which would be visible.
/// Currently, the virtual scrolling controller ignores this case.
/// The long term plan is for each child to be clipped to a reasonable range around itself.
/// The details of how large this clipping area will be have not been decided.
///
/// This will mean that once this is done, the behaviour with transformed widgets will be consistent but not
/// necessarily intuitive (that is, for a given row on screen, the displayed content will always be the same,
/// but some widgets with transforms might not be visible - in the worst case, completely hidden).
// TODO: Implement this.
///
/// ### Focus
///
/// Currently, this widget does not correctly handle focused child widgets.
/// This means that if (for example) the user is typing in a text box in a virtual scroll, and scrolls down,
/// continuing to type will stop working.
///
/// ### Accessibility
///
/// A proper virtual scrolling list needs accessibility support (such as for scrolling, but
/// also to ensure that focus does not get trapped, that the correct set of items are reported,
/// if/that there are more items following, etc.).
/// This has not yet been designed, and will be a follow-up.
///
/// ### Scrollbars
///
/// There is not yet any integration with scrollbars for this widget.
/// This is planned; however there is no universally correct scrollbar implementation for virtual scrolling.
/// This widget will support user-provided scrollbar types, through some yet-to-be-determined mechanism.
/// There will also be provided implementations of reasonable scrollbar kinds.
///
/// ## Valid range
///
/// Scrolling at the end of the valid range is locked, however it is not currently supported to lock scrolling
/// such that the bottom of the last item cannot be above the bottom of the `VirtualScroll`.
/// That is, it is always possible to scroll past the loaded items to the background (if the user
/// reaches the end of the valid range).
///
/// If the valid range is empty, i.e. the start and the end are equal, then there is jank which we haven't
/// resolved. However, this case should not cause crashes.
