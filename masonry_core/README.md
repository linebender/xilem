Traits and types of the Masonry toolkit.

Masonry gives you a platform to create windows (using [winit] as a backend) each with a tree of widgets. It also gives you tools to inspect that widget tree at runtime, write unit tests on it, and generally have an easier time debugging and maintaining your app.

See `masonry` crate for more details.
