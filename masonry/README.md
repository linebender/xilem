Masonry is a foundational framework for building GUI libraries in Rust.

The developers of Masonry are developing [Xilem], a reactive UI library built on top of Masonry.
Masonry's API is geared towards creating GUI libraries; if you are creating an application, we recommend also considering Xilem.

Masonry gives you a platform-independent manager, which owns and maintains a widget tree.
It also gives you tools to inspect that widget tree at runtime, write unit tests on it, and generally have an easier time debugging and maintaining your app.

The framework is not opinionated about what your user-facing abstraction will be: you can implement immediate-mode GUI, the Elm architecture, functional reactive GUI, etc, on top of Masonry.

It *is* opinionated about its internals: things like text focus, pointer interactions and accessibility events are often handled in a centralized way.

Masonry is built on top of:

- [Vello][vello] and [wgpu][vello::wgpu] for 2D graphics.
- [Parley][parley] for the text stack.
- [AccessKit][accesskit] for plugging into accessibility APIs.

There are currently two backends for creating windows:

- [masonry_winit] for most platforms.
- `masonry_android_view` for Android.

## Example

The to-do-list example looks like this, using `masonry_winit` as the backend:

```rust
use masonry::core::{ErasedAction, NewWidget, Widget, WidgetId, WidgetPod};
use masonry::dpi::LogicalSize;
use masonry::properties::types::{Length, AsUnit};
use masonry::theme::default_property_set;
use masonry::widgets::{Button, ButtonPress, Flex, Label, Portal, TextAction, TextInput};
use masonry_winit::app::{AppDriver, DriverCtx, NewWindow, WindowId};
use masonry_winit::winit::window::Window;

struct Driver {
    next_task: String,
    window_id: WindowId,
}

impl AppDriver for Driver {
    fn on_action(
        &mut self,
        window_id: WindowId,
        ctx: &mut DriverCtx<'_, '_>,
        _widget_id: WidgetId,
        action: ErasedAction,
    ) {
        debug_assert_eq!(window_id, self.window_id, "unknown window");

        if action.is::<ButtonPress>() {
            ctx.render_root(window_id).edit_root_widget(|mut root| {
                let mut portal = root.downcast::<Portal<Flex>>();
                let mut flex = Portal::child_mut(&mut portal);
                Flex::add_child(&mut flex, Label::new(self.next_task.clone()).with_auto_id());
            });
        } else if action.is::<TextAction>() {
            let action = *action.downcast::<TextAction>().unwrap();
            match action {
                TextAction::Changed(new_text) => {
                    self.next_task = new_text.clone();
                }
                _ => {}
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    const WIDGET_SPACING: Length = Length::const_px(5.0);

    let main_widget = Portal::new(
        Flex::column()
            .with_child(NewWidget::new(
                Flex::row()
                    .with_flex_child(TextInput::new("").with_auto_id(), 1.0)
                    .with_child(
                        Button::new(
                            Label::new("Add task").with_auto_id()
                        ).with_auto_id()
                    ),
            ))
            .with_spacer(WIDGET_SPACING)
            .with_auto_id(),
    );

    let window_size = LogicalSize::new(400.0, 400.0);
    let window_attributes = Window::default_attributes()
        .with_title("To-do list")
        .with_resizable(true)
        .with_min_inner_size(window_size);

    let driver = Driver {
        next_task: String::new(),
        window_id: WindowId::next(),
    };
    let event_loop = masonry_winit::app::EventLoop::with_user_event()
        .build()
        .unwrap();
    masonry_winit::app::run_with(
        event_loop,
        vec![NewWindow::new_with_id(
            driver.window_id,
            window_attributes,
            NewWidget::new(main_widget).erased(),
        )],
        driver,
        default_property_set(),
    )
    .unwrap();
}
```

## Crate feature flags

The following feature flags are available:

- `tracy`: Enables creating output for the [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) profiler using [`tracing-tracy`][tracing_tracy].
  This can be used by installing Tracy and connecting to a Masonry with this feature enabled.

## Debugging features

Masonry apps currently ship with several debugging features built in:

- A rudimentary widget inspector - toggled by the F11 key.
- A debug mode painting widget layout rectangles - toggled by the F12 key.
- Automatic registration of a [tracing] subscriber, which outputs to the console and to a file in the dev profile.

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Masonry has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.88** and later.

Future versions of Masonry might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

## Community
