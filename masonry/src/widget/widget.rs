///
/// Whenever external events affect the given widget, methods [`on_event`],

/// are called. Later on, when the widget is laid out and displayed, methods
/// [`layout`](Self::layout) and [`paint`](Self::paint) are called.

/// These trait methods are provided with a corresponding context. The widget can
/// request things and cause actions by calling methods on that context.

/// Widgets also have a [`children`](Self::children) method. Leaf widgets return an empty array,
/// whereas container widgets return an array of [`WidgetRef`]. Container widgets
/// have some validity invariants to maintain regarding their children.
///
/// Generally speaking, widgets aren't used directly. They are stored in
/// [`WidgetPod`](crate::WidgetPod)s. Widget methods are called by `WidgetPod`s, and the
