/// Generic state for all widgets in the hierarchy.
///
/// This struct contains the metadata that passes need to know about widgets and that
/// widgets don't store themselves.
///
/// All context types include a reference to a `WidgetState`, so widgets can query
/// information about their own state and set invalidation flags.
/// Context types for render passes have a shared `&WidgetState`. Context types for
/// other passes have a `&mut WidgetState`.
///
/// In general, the only way to get a `&mut WidgetState` should be in a pass or as part of a
/// [`WidgetMut`]. Both should reborrow the parent widget state and call
/// [`WidgetState::merge_up`] at the end so that invalidations are always bubbled up.
///
/// ## Naming scheme
///
/// Some fields follow a naming scheme:
/// - `request_xxx`: this specific widget has requested the xxx pass to run on it.
/// - `needs_xxx`: this widget or a descendant has requested the xxx pass to run on it.
/// - `is_xxx`: this widget has the xxx property.
/// - `has_xxx`: this widget or a descendant has the xxx property.
///
/// ## Resetting flags
///
/// Generally, the `needs_foobar` and `request_foobar` flags will be reset to
/// false during the "foobar" pass after calling the "foobar" method.
///
/// In principle this shouldn't be a problem because most passes shouldn't be
/// able to request themselves. The exception is the anim pass: an anim frame can
/// (and usually will) request a new anim frame.
///
/// ## Zombie flags
///
/// Masonry's passes should be designed to avoid what we'll call "zombie flags".
///
/// Zombie flags are when a pass "foobar" fails to clear `needs_foobar` flags of some
/// widgets by the time it's complete. Even if the pass works correctly, failing to
/// clear the flags means they'll be propagated up in [`WidgetState::merge_up`] by every
/// other pass, which means the widget tree will keep requesting the same passes over
/// and over. Zombie flags are terrible for performance and power-efficiency.
