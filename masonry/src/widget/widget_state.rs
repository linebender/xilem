/// Generic state for all widgets in the hierarchy.
///
/// This struct contains the metadata that passes need to know about widgets and that
/// widgets don't store themselves.
///
/// All context types include a reference to a `WidgetState`, so widgets can query
/// information about their own state and set invalidation flags.
/// Context types for render passes have a shared `&WidgetState`. Context types for
/// other passes have a `&mut WidgetState`.
///
/// In general, the only way to get a `&mut WidgetState` should be in a pass or as part of a
/// [`WidgetMut`]. Both should reborrow the parent widget state and call
/// [`WidgetState::merge_up`] at the end so that invalidations are always bubbled up.
///
/// ## Naming scheme
///
/// Some fields follow a naming scheme:
/// - `request_xxx`: this specific widget has requested the xxx pass to run on it
/// - `needs_xxx`: this widget or a descendant has requested the xxx pass to run on it
/// - `is_xxx`: this widget has the xxx property
/// - `has_xxx`: this widget or an ancestor has the xxx property
///
