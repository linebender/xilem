// - needs_xxx: means this widget or one of its descendants has requested the xxx pass

// FIXME https://github.com/linebender/xilem/issues/376 - Make a note documenting this: the only way to get a &mut WidgetState should be in a pass.
// A pass should reborrow the parent widget state (to avoid crossing wires) and call merge_up at
// the end so that invalidations are always bubbled up.
// Widgets with methods that require invalidation (eg Label::set_text) should take a
// &mut WidgetState as a parameter. Because passes reborrow the parent WidgetState, the only
// way to call such a method is during a pass on the given widget.
