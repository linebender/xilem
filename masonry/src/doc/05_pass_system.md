Masonry's internal architecture is based on a set of **passes**, which are computations run over a subset of the widget tree during every frame.

Passes can be split into roughly three categories:

- **Event passes** are triggered by user interaction.
- **Rewrite passes** run after every event pass, may run multiple times until all invalidation flags are cleared.
- **Render passes** run just before rendering a new frame.

Note that unless otherwise specified, all passes run over widgets in depth-first preorder, where child order is determined by their position in the `children_ids()` array.


## Event passes

When a user interacts with the application in some way, like a mouse click, Masonry runs an **event pass** over the tree.
There are three types of event passes:

- **on_pointer_event:** covers positional events from the mouse and other pointing devices (pen, stylus, touchpad, etc).
- **on_text_event:** text input events like keyboard presses, IME, clipboard paste, etc.
- **on_access_event:** events from the OS's accessibility API.

When an event occurs, the application selects the widget targeted by the event.
For pointer events, this is either the widget under the pointer or the widget with pointer capture.
For text and accessibility events, this is the widget with focus.

The widget's event handling method (`on_pointer_event`, `on_text_event`, or `on_access_event`) is called.
Then, the same method is called for each of the widget's parents, up to the root.
This behavior is known in browsers as event bubbling.

### Animation pass

The **update_anim** pass runs an animation frame, which occurs at set intervals if the widget tree includes animated widgets.

It runs in depth-first preorder on all animated widgets in the tree.

The animation pass may be considered as a special event pass: it's not triggered by user interaction, and it doesn't bubble, but it's also triggered externally and sets off the rewrite passes.


## Rewrite passes

After an event pass, some flags may have been changed, and some values may have been invalidated and need to be recomputed.
To address these invalidations, Masonry runs a set of **rewrite passes** over the tree:

- **mutate:** Runs callbacks with mutable access to the tree.
- **update_widget_tree:** Updates the tree when widgets are added or removed.
- **update_disabled:** Updates the disabled status of widgets.
- **update_stashed:** Updates the stashed status of widgets.
- **update_focus_chain:** Updates the focus chain. (Internal-only, doesn't call widget methods.)
- **update_focus:** Updates the focused status of widgets.
- **layout:** Computes the layout of the widget tree.
- **update_scrolls:** Updates the scroll positions of widgets.
- **compose:** Assigns transforms to widgets.
- **update_pointer:** Updates the hovered status of widgets and the current cursor icon.

The layout and compose passes have methods with matching names in the Widget trait.
The update_xxx passes call the widgets' update method.

By default, each of these passes completes without doing any work, unless pass-dependent invalidation flags are set.
Each pass can generally request work for later passes; for instance, the mutate pass can invalidate the layout of a widget, in which case the layout pass will run on that widget and its children and parents.

Passes may also request work for *previous* passes, in which case all rewrite passes are run again in sequence.
For instance, the update_pointer pass may change a widget's size, requiring another layout pass.

To avoid infinite loops in those cases, the number of reruns has a static limit.
If passes are still requested past that limit, they're delayed to a later frame.

### The mutate pass

The **mutate** pass runs a list of callbacks with mutable access to the widget tree.
These callbacks can be queued with the `mutate_later()` method of various context types.

"Mutable access" means that those callbacks are given a [`WidgetMut`] to the widget that requested them, something that is otherwise only accessible from the owner of the global [`RenderRoot`] object.

If a callback is scheduled to run on a widget which is deleted before the callback is run, that callback is silently dropped.

*Note:* The mutate pass is meant to be *an escape hatch*.
It covers widgets which don't quite fit into the pass system and future use-cases that we didn't foresee while developing Masonry.
It's more powerful and gives complete access to the tree, but is also slightly more expensive and less idiomatic than doing things in other passes.

Widgets should try to fit their logic into the other passes, and use `mutate_later()` sparsely.

### Update passes

Update passes mostly run internal calculations.
They compute if some widget's property has changed, and send it a matching `update` event (see "Status" section below).

For instance, if a user presses `Tab` and text focus moves to the next widget, Masonry will run the `update_focus` pass, which will automatically changed the "focused" status of the previously-focused widget and the newly-focused widget, and call their `update()` methods with relevant events.

### Update tree pass

The `update_widget_tree` pass is a special case.
It is called when new widgets are added to the tree, or existing widgets are removed.

It will call the `register_children()` widget method on container widgets whose children changed, then the `update()` method with the `WidgetAdded` event on new widgets.

### Layout pass

The layout pass runs bidirectionally, passing constraints from the top down and getting back sizes and other layout info from the bottom up.

It is subject to be reworked in the future to be closer to the semantics of web layout engines and the Taffy crate.

Unlike with other passes, container widgets' `Widget::layout()` method must "manually" recurse by calling [`LayoutCtx::run_layout`] then [`LayoutCtx::place_child`] for each of their children.

Not doing so is a logical bug, and may trigger debug assertions.

### Compose pass

The **compose** pass runs top-down and assigns transforms to children.
Transform-only layout changes (e.g. scrolling) should request compose instead of requesting layout.

Compose is meant to be a cheaper way to position widgets than layout.
Because the compose pass is more limited than layout, it's easier to recompute in many situations.

For instance, if a widget in a list changes size, its siblings and parents must be re-laid out to account for the change; whereas changing a given widget's transform only affects its children.


## Render passes

Event and rewrite passes can invalidate how the widget tree is presented to the user.

If that happens, a redraw frame will be requested from the environment (e.g. the Winit event loop).
When the environment applies the redraw, it will run the **render passes** as needed:

- **paint:** The paint pass gets a Vello Scene description from each widget.
These scenes are then stitched together in pre-order: first the parent, then its first child, then *its* first child, etc.
- **accessibility:** The accessibility pass gets an AccessKit node description from each widget.
These nodes together form the accessibility tree.

Methods for these passes should be written under the assumption that they can be skipped or called multiple times for arbitrary reasons.
Therefore, their ability to affect the widget tree is limited.


## External mutation

Code with mutable access to the `RenderRoot`, like the Xilem app runner, can get mutable access to the root widget and all its children through the `edit_root_widget()` method, which takes a callback and passes it a `WidgetMut` to the root widget.

This is in effect a "mutate" pass which only processes one callback.

External mutation is how Xilem applies any changes to the widget tree produced by its reactive step.

`RenderRoot::edit_root_widget()` triggers the entire set of rewrite passes before returning.


## Pass context types

Some notes about pass context types:

- Render passes should be pure and can be skipped occasionally, therefore their context types ([`PaintCtx`] and [`AccessCtx`]) can't set invalidation flags or send signals.
- The `layout` and `compose` passes lay out all widgets, which are transiently invalid during the passes, therefore [`LayoutCtx`]and [`ComposeCtx`] cannot access the size and position of the `self` widget.
They can access the layout of children if they have already been laid out.
- For the same reason, [`LayoutCtx`]and [`ComposeCtx`] cannot create a `WidgetRef` reference to a child.
- [`MutateCtx`], [`EventCtx`] and [`UpdateCtx`] can let you add and remove children.
- [`RegisterCtx`] can't do anything except register children.
- [`QueryCtx`] provides read-only information about the widget.
